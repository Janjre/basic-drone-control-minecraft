[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WIv8MoeyeE0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WIv8MoeyeE0)

This was made with Valkarien Skies Clockwork and Computer Craft: Tweaked

All the files are in computer/1

The Input controllers take numerous binary inputs and turn them into a number 0-15.
The inputs are then read and decoded by the drone.lua scripts, which then outputs what amount of resistance should be sent to the propellers.

## Loading the schematic
Download the schematic. You can load it with a schematicanon or other mods.
Give the top computer InputControl.lua
Give the central computer drone.lua
Give the bottom computer InputControl2.lua
Give the other comuters R-Ltransfer.lua
Make it a physics object with a physics infuser or ship assembler from VS: Tournament.
Get a Linked controller.
Find the redstone link with the warped wood. Bind it to w
Find the Redstone link with andesite. Bind it to a
Find the Redstone Link with Sand. Bind it to s
Find the Redstone Link with dirt. Bind it to D
Find the Redstone Link with Waxed Weathered Cut Copper. Bind it to space
Get in the seat. Use Space to go up. W to go forward. S to go backward. A to go right. D to go left. (You can swap A and D if you want by just changed what you bind with the linked controller)
You should now be able to fly it. You can get help with the process in the comments section of the youtube video.
